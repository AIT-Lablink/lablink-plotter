# The Lablink Plotter

## About

This package provides LabLink clients that visualize data as plotted graphs in a separate window.
These plotted graphs are continuously updated while the client is running, showing the input data as a function of time.
For more information, please refer to the [online documentation](https://ait-lablink.readthedocs.io/projects/lablink-plotter).
